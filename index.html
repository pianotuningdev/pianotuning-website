			Proudly serving the South Side of Chicago!

		<p>
			I began studying piano at about the age of 9 under the tutalage of my first piano teacher, Mrs. Portia M. Harris. I completed all 6 books of the Eda Mae Burnam Piano Course with her guidance, which has given me the invaluable skill of reading music.
		</p>
		<p>
			Starting around 1998 to 2002, I studied with Joe Caruso. While studying with Mr. Caruso, I was introduced to competitive piano, enrolling in competions such as the Illinois Music Association Competition, and Geneva Swedish Days Granquist Piano Competion. My repetoire during that time include some sonatas of Clemeti, and among my favorites to play at that time, Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C# Minor. It was also with Mr. Caruso that I was introduced to jazz harmony, learing an expanded interval palette that extended into the 9, 11, and 13.
		</p>
		<p>
			I received my B.A. in Music from Lewis University in 2008.
		</p>
		<p>
			I continue to study piano in the classical and jazz traditions.
