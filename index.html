		<p>
			I began studying piano at about the age of 9 (around 1994). Under the tutalage of Mrs. Portia M. Harris, I completed all 6 books of the Eda Mae Burnam Piano Course over the course of the next few years, which has given me the invaluable skill of reading music.
		</p>
		<p>
			Under the direction of Joe Caruso, I was introduced to competitive piano, enrolling in competions such as the Illinois Music Association Competition, and Geneva Swedish Days Granquist Piano Competion. My repetoire during that time include some sonatas of Clemeti, and among my favorite to play at that time, Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C# Minor. It was also with Mr. Caruso that I was introduced to jazz, learing an expanded interval palette that extended into the 9, 11, and 13.
		</p>
		<p>
			I received my B.A. in Music from Lewis University in 2008.
		</p>
		<p>
			I continue to study piano in the classical and jazz traditions.
