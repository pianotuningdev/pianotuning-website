		<p> 
		 Tuning: $150
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Your piano will be aurally tuned. I do not use an electronic tuning device, or a felt mute strip to tune your piano. I do use my phone to tune A4, and other software to check unisons, but they are not required. An appointment may last up to 4 hours depending on how far away your piano is from standard pitch, or to bring the piano in tune.

		<p>
			American Standard pitch is A4 = 440Hz. To bring your piano to standard pitch is inclued in my tuning service.
		</p>
		<p>
			My tuning method producess multiple pure invervals at the 11th, 12th, 19th, and Triple Octave. I can show the pureness of these intervals through any audio editing software that shows waveforms.
