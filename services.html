		<p> 
		 Tuning: $150

		<p>
			Your piano will be aurally tuned. An appointment may last up to 2 hours depending on how far away your piano is from standard pitch, or to bring the piano in tune.
		</p>

			Concert Tuning
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			American Standard pitch is A4 = 440Hz. 
		</p>
		<p>	
			To bring your piano to standard pitch is included in my tuning service. If your piano is far away from standard pitch, and then brought to standard pitch, you may notice your piano going out of tune before the next recommended service appoinment, which is on aveage every 6 months. This is because the piano is adjusting to increased tension on the soundboard. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My tuning method producess multiple pure invervals at the 11th, 12th, 19th, and Triple Octave. I use a procedure where I tune two stings at once, which allows me not to use a mute stip so that I can make the unisons as I go along. I can show the pureness of these intervals through any audio editing software that shows waveforms at your request.
