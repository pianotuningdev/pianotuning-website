		<p> 
		 Tuning: $200
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Your piano will be aurally tuned. An appointment may last up to 3 hours depending on how far away your piano is from standard pitch, or to bring the piano in tune.

			Concert Tuning
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			American Standard pitch is A4 = 440Hz. 
		</p>
		<p>	
			To bring your piano to standard pitch is included in my tuning service. If your piano is far away from standard pitch, and then brought to standard pitch, you may notice your piano going out of tune before the next recommended service appoinment, which is on aveage every 6 months. This is because the piano is adjusting to increased tension on the soundboard. You may want to have it retuned again before the recommended 6 months if it bothers you. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My tuning method producess multiple pure invervals at the 11th, 12th, 19th, and Triple Octave. I use a procedure where I tune two stings at once, which allows me not to use a mute stip so that I can produce clean unisons as I go along, instead of at the end like most conventional tuners. I can show the pureness of these intervals through any audio editing software that shows waveforms at your request.
